# Course Acknowledgments
{:.no_toc}

The content and structure of CSC 4220 has been adapted from other excellent courses and curricula. Specifically, we thank the dedicated faculty and instructors at UC Berkeley that created the Data 100 course for the open source material they have generously provided.

The *Learning Data Science* textbook that this course follows is authored by Sam Lau, Joseph Gonzalez, and Deborah Nolan.
