{:.no_toc}

* TOC
{:toc}

## Introduction

Students in the graduate version of the course will complete 2 additional assignments.
- A modern book on machine learning approved by the instructor (ie. Genius Makers, The Alignment Problem, Human Compatible)
- An original group project

## Modern Book and Research Papers on Machine Learning

The field of machine learning is constantly evolving but has, at this point, a considerable history. There are several wonderful books on machine learning that provide broad insight acquired from a lifetime of work in machine learning. 

The course staff will be reading "Algorithms to Live By" By Brian Christian and Tom Griffiths. Other options are "Genius Makers", "The Alignment Problem", and "Human Compatible". Other books not on this list are allowed, but must be approved by the instructor. 

There will be an **afternoon discussion** about the reading to be scheduled in the **first half of the semester over donuts and coffee**. The discussion will be centered around machine learning history, modern problems in machine learning, and the future of machine learning. 

5220 students will be required to attend. Any 4220 students who choose to make use of the available extra credit by reading one of the books will also be invited!

## Project 

Students in the graduate course will form into groups, and then propose and conduct an original project that utilizes concepts from both machine learning and data science. Projects related to climate data, natural language processing, or machine vision are encouraged. 

There will be 4 milestones with deadlines to be released soon - proposal and rubric, background literature, implementation, and evaluation.
