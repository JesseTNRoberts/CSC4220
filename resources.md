# Resources
{:.no_toc}

Here is a collection of resources that will help you learn more about various concepts and skills covered in the class. Reading and studying beyond the course material provides a 3 dimensional perspective while only seeing the course perspective is closer to 1 dimensional. It's important to be exposed to different perspectives and ways of understanding familiar concepts.

## Course Website

All lecture materials and notes will be posted on the course website.

## Textbook 

This course has two official texts. Both texts are available for free online (legally) at the provided links.

- [Learning Data Science](https://learningds.org/intro.html) by Sam Lau, Joey Gonzalez, and Deb Nolan
- [Introduction to Statistical Learning with Python](https://www.statlearning.com) by James, Witten, Hastie, Tibshirani


## Coding and Mathematics Resources


#### Pandas

  - [Pandas API Reference](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/index.html)
  - [The Pandas Cookbook](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/jvns/pandas-cookbook/tree/master/cookbook/): Overview of some of the basic Pandas functions. 
  - [Python for Data Science](http://wavedatalab.github.io/datawithpython/index.html) Notebooks demonstrating Pandas functionality.

#### Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter notebooks can be executed and edited in a number of IDEs. I prefer to work with jupyter notebooks in [google collaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) and this will be the official platform which students are encouraged to use. Others may prefer to use a local IDE like [visual studio](https://code.visualstudio.com). Students are free to choose their preferred platform. However, course staff may be unable to help resolve IDE specific issues.

- [Tutorial](https://saturncloud.io/blog/how-to-run-a-downloaded-jupyter-notebook-on-google-colaboratory/) for uploading .ipynb file to google colab

#### Calculus and Linear Algebra

**Calculus**:
In terms of calculus, you will need to know a few things, most of which are covered within the space of the first homework and lab. Specifically, you will need to know univariate calculus rules like: Taking derivatives of a univariate function (i.e. f(x), where x is the only variable); Derivative power rule; Knowing derivatives of mathematical functions like: sinx,cosx,logx,ex; Chain rule; Product rule (rarely); Derivatives of sums. We will expect some multivariate fluency like: Taking partial derivatives of a multivariate function (i.e. f(x,y,z), where x,y,z are all variables); Gradients (the concept).

**Linear Algebra**:

Concepts roughly in order of importance:
vectors, matrices; rank/nullity;
inner products, orthogonality, norms;
linear independence;
orthonormal matrices;
vector spaces;
projections;
invertibility.

### Pandemic Protocols
{:.no_toc}
Each student must take personal responsibility for knowing and following any University protocol related to pandemics and other public health events. Students are expected to follow all directives published by Tennessee Tech on its official webpage. As conditions related to the COVID-19 pandemic change, the University's COVID-19 protocols are also likely to change. Students are expected to monitor the University's official webpage to stay up to date on public health protocols.
